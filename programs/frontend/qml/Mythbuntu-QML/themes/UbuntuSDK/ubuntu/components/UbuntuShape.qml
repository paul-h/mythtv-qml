    \brief The UbuntuShape item provides a standard Ubuntu shaped rounded rectangle.

    The UbuntuShape is used where a rounded rectangle is needed either filled
    with a color or an image that it crops.

    When given with a \l color it is applied with an overlay blending as a
    vertical gradient going from \l color to \l gradientColor.
    Two corner \l radius are available, "small" (default) and "medium", that
    determine the size of the corners.
    Optionally, an Image can be passed that will be displayed inside the
    UbuntuShape and cropped to fit it.

    Examples:
    \qml
        import "../components"

        UbuntuShape {
            color: "lightblue"
            radius: "medium"
        }
    \endqml

    \qml
        import "../components"

        UbuntuShape {
            image: Image {
                source: "icon.png"
            }
        }
    \endqml

    \qml
        import "../components"

        UbuntuShape {
            maskSource: "customMask.sci"
            borderSource: "customBorder.sci"
        }
    \endqml
