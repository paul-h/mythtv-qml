    \brief CheckBox is a component with two states, checked or unchecked. It can
    be used to set boolean options. The behavior is the same as \l Switch, the
    only difference is the graphical style.

    \b{This component is under heavy development.}

    Example:
    \qml
    Item {
        CheckBox {
            checked: true
        }
    }
    \endqml
*/
AbstractButton {
    id: checkBox

    // FIXME: see FIXME above
    Theming.ItemStyle.class: "checkbox"
    width: Theming.ComponentUtils.delegateProperty(checkBox, "implicitWidth", units.gu(4))
    height: Theming.ComponentUtils.delegateProperty(checkBox, "implicitHeight", units.gu(4))

    /*!
      \preliminary
      Specifies whether the checkbox is checked or not. By default the property
      is set to false.
    */
    property bool checked: false

    /*!

    onClicked: checked = !checked
}
