    To specify information for the Android manifest file, select \gui Projects >
    \gui Run > \gui {Package configurations}. The Android system uses the
    information from the file to start application components.

    \section2 Specifying Package Data

    In the \gui Manifest tab, you can select the API level to use for the
    Android target SDK and the name and version number for the application
    package.

    For more information about Android API levels, see
    \l{http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels}
    {What is API Level?}.

    The minimum API level is android-4 for Necessitas and android-9 for Qt 5.
    \QC does not allow you to select an API level that the Qt version specified
    for the kit does not support.

    \note The android-4 API level does not support multitouch. If your
    application needs multitouch, select a higher API level.

    In the \gui {Package name} field, enter a package name for the application.
    The application is launched by an automatically generated Java launcher that
    is packaged with the application into an Android package (.apk). For more
    information, see
    \l{http://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html}
    {Android Application Fundamentals}.

    \section2 Specifying Application Data

    In the \gui Application tab, you can select an icon for the application and
    give the application a name.

    \section2 Setting Permissions

    In the \gui Permissions tab, you can specify the permissions that your
    application needs. Users are asked to grant the permissions when they
    install the application. Android OS then grants the application access to
    the appropriate data and features.

    Select from existing Android permissions or add new ones to deploy the
    application to a particular Android OS.

    \section2 Selecting Qt Libraries

    In the \gui Libraries tab, specify which Qt libraries the application uses.
    To automatically determine this, select \gui {Read Infomation from
    Application (Must Be Compiled)}. Alternatively, you can manually select the
    Qt libraries and the external libraries you think your application needs.
    Make sure to arrange the libraries so that depended libraries appear before
    the ones that depend on them.

    These entries are used by the Ministro tool to determine which Qt libraries
    to download.

    In addition, the Java Loader uses this list to determine which Qt Libraries
    and other prebundled libraries to load with your application.

    \section2 Signing Android Packages

    In the \gui {Sign Package} tab, you can sign the Android package by using
    a private key from the keystore. To create new keys, select \gui Create.
